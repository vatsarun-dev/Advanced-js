**3.** Write a fetch request that logs the **response object** before converting it to JSON.

**4.** Fetch data and log `"Data loaded"` after the JSON is received.

**5.** Fetch users and print the **total number of users returned**.

**6.** Write a fetch request that handles errors using `.catch()`.

## Promises (.then / .catch)

**7.** Create a Promise that resolves with `"Hello"` and print it using `.then()`.

**8.** Create a Promise that rejects with `"Something went wrong"` and handle it using `.catch()`.

**9.** Write a Promise chain with **two `.then()` blocks**.

**10.** Create a Promise that resolves after **2 seconds** using `setTimeout`.

**11.** Write a Promise chain that prints `"Step 1"` then `"Step 2"`.

## Async / Await

**12.** Convert the following code into `async/await`: `fetch(url).then(res => res.json()).then(data => console.log(data))`

**13.** Write an async function that fetches data and logs it.

**14.** Write an async function that fetches data and stores it in a variable.

**15.** Write an async function that waits for a Promise that resolves after **1 second**.

**16.** Write an async function that fetches data and prints `"Finished fetching"` after the data is received.

## Error Handling

**17.** Write a `try/catch` block that handles an error from `JSON.parse()`.

**18.** Create a function that throws an error `"Invalid input"`.

**19.** Write a `try/catch` example that prints `"Error occurred"` in the catch block.

**20.** Write a `try/catch/finally` example where the finally block prints `"Always runs"`.

**21.** Use `try/catch` inside an async function.

## ES Modules

**22.** Create a file `utils.js` that exports a variable `name = "JavaScript"` using **named export**.

**23.** Import the `name` variable in another file and log it.

**24.** Create a **default export** function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum.

**25.** Import the default exported `add` function in another file and use it.
